### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer working in the past 20 and so years for **Syncrosoft**, the company which develops **Oxygen XML Editor/Author/Developer**. 

I worked a lot on the support in **Oxygen XML** for visually editing XML documents using CSS for styling, change tracking, **DITA XML** editing, custom actions and side views like the **DITA Maps Manager** view. I've also worked to develop the **APIs** which can be used to develop plugins for **Oxygen** or to customize advanced framework support.

I do lots of technical support for the features I worked on in **Oxygen**, visual editing customizations, questions related to the **APIs** used to build plugins, framework customization questions and in general **DITA XML*** based publishing questions. 
The channels where you can find me are:

  - The Oxygen XML support email address: https://www.oxygenxml.com/contact.html
  - The Oxygen XML Forum: https://www.oxygenxml.com/forum/
  - DITA Users List: https://dita-users.groups.io/g/main
