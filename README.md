### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer working in the past 20 and so years for **Syncrosoft**, the company which develops **Oxygen XML Editor/Author/Developer**. 

I worked a lot on the support in **Oxygen XML** for visually editing XML documents using CSS for styling, change tracking, **DITA XML** editing, custom actions and side views like the **DITA Maps Manager** view. I've also worked to develop the **APIs** which can be used to develop plugins for **Oxygen** or to customize advanced framework support. Recently I worked on developing AI-based tools for editing DITA XML content with Oxygen.

I do lots of technical support for the features I worked on in **Oxygen**, visual editing customizations, questions related to the **APIs** used to build plugins, framework customization questions and in general **DITA XML** based publishing questions. 
The channels where you can find me are:

  - The Oxygen XML support email address: https://www.oxygenxml.com/contact.html
  - The Oxygen XML Forum: https://www.oxygenxml.com/forum/
  - DITA Users List: https://dita-users.groups.io/g/main
  - Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/

I also write articles and generally maintain the Oxygen XML Blog: https://blog.oxygenxml.com/

I contribute small bug fixes, ideas and suggestions to the DITA Open Toolkit project: https://www.dita-ot.org/who_we_are

During these years I've developed quite a few open source project on the Oxygen XML GitHub organization, most of them plugins for the DITA Open Toolkit: https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Adita-ot-plugin+org%3Aoxygenxml&type=Repositories
Some of the most useful plugins include the plugins to add support for Latex equation and PlantUML/Mermaid diagrams in DITA XML content.

I enjoy reading, a list with some of the books I've read: https://github.com/raducoravu/raducoravu/blob/main/books.md
